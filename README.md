# Codeforces – Competitive Programming

This repo is where I keep my Codeforces work—both contest submissions and practice problems. It’s mainly a place to track progress, experiment with ideas, and improve problem-solving skills over time.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **contests/** – solutions submitted during Codeforces contests
* **practice/** – problems solved outside contests, revisits of concepts, and experiments

## 🎯 What I’m Working Toward

* Getting better at algorithmic thinking
* Solving problems faster and more accurately under time pressure
* Writing clearer, more reliable competitive programming code
* Keeping a transparent record of progress

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++ (20/23)
* **Build:** g++ / CMake when needed
* **Environment:** Linux & Windows

## ✅ Extra Notes

* Some folders include short explanations or notes
* Not every solution is perfect—learning is ongoing
* Feedback is always welcome 🙂
