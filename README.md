# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my competitive programming work, including contest submissions and practice problems.
It serves as a place to track progress, experiment with ideas, and steadily improve problem-solving and implementation skills.

## Repository Structure

- **contests/** – solutions submitted during programming contests
- **practice/** – problems solved outside contests, concept revisits, and experiments

## Commit Message Convention

To keep the history clear and readable, commits generally follow this format:

- **contest:** contest submissions or fixes
- **practice:** non-contest problem solving
- **repo:** repository structure or configuration changes
- **docs:** documentation updates
- **tools:** helper scripts or tooling

## Goals

- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Solve problems more efficiently under time pressure
- Write clearer and more reliable competitive programming code
- Maintain a transparent record of progress over time

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++ (20/23)
- **Build:** g++ / CMake when needed
- **Environment:** Linux and Windows

## Notes

- Some directories include short explanations or personal notes
- Not every solution is optimal; learning and iteration are intentional
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome
